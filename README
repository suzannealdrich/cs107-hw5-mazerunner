Assignment: MazeRunnerName: Suzanne Aldrich, a.k.a. aigeantaE-mail: aigeanta@stanford.eduTA: ErikComments: I really like Java, but it took a long time to figure out how toset up an environment I could program in. If it were designed to be anapplet I could have tested it in a browser instead of wasting a few daystrying to find a copy of MacX (which is why this program is late).
